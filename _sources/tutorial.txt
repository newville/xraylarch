Larch Tutorial
============================

This chapter describes the Larch language and provides an introduction into
processing data using Larch.  An important goal of Larch is to make writing
and modifying data analysis as simple as possible.  The tutorial here tries
to make few assumptions about your experience with scientific
programming.  On the other hand, Larch is a language for processing of
scientific data, the expected audience is expected to have a technical
background, familiarity with using programs for scientific data analysis.
In addition, some understanding of the concepts of how scientific data is
stored on computers and of the basics of programming.

The Larch language is implemented in and heavily based on Python.
Knowledge of Python will greatly simplify learning Larch, and vice versa.
This shared syntax is intentional, so that as you learn Larch, you will
also be learning Python, which can be used to extend Larch.  Alternatively,
knowledge of Python will make Larch easy to learn.  For further details on
Python, including tutorials, see the Python documentation at
http://python.org/
